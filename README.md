# Text-Analysis-Template

The given example of text analysis includes 4 steps:

1) Lemmatization of text and removal of stop words
2) Frequency analysis
3) Sentiment analysis
4) Topic modeling

Personal experience shows that the best results  for the last 2 steps are obtained with transformer-based approaches. For Sentiment analysis in this template the rubert-base-cased-sentiment model is used, for topic modeling the BERTopic is used.
